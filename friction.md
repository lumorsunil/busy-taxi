# friction

Ff = frictional force

Ff = uN
u = static or kinetic frictional coefficient
N = normal force between the surface

N = Fg = m ag
m = mass
ag = acceleration of gravity (9.81m/s^2)

Ff = u m ag

u =

Rubber vs Dry Asphalt

- static = 0.9
- kinetic = 0.5

Rubber vs Wet Ashpalt

- static = 0.9
- kinetic = 0.25
