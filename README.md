# Busy Taxi

This is a game I made for a [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEoxoIGsHY8&list=PL4EtwuhtXRFx8RKwWeKgEmvyQRQC602cq).

It is currently in a state of disarray, it is playable but there are a couple of issues:

- Something happened with the physics so the cards move really slow. Tweaking needs to be done to the forces.
- The roads are not properly drawn.
- Probably other issues that I haven't found yet.

I'm leaving this here for educational purposes for those that want to see the code.
